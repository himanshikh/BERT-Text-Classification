# 🧠 BERT Fine-Tuning for Text Classification

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder 
Representations from Transformers)** for a **binary text classification** 
task using **PyTorch**.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
The goal is to classify sentences into predefined labels (e.g., 
positive/negative sentiment) using transfer learning with a pretrained 
BERT model (`bert-base-uncased`).

---

## 🧩 Steps Implemented
1. Data preprocessing from `train_10k.txt` and `val_1k.txt`
2. Tokenization using HuggingFace’s BERT tokenizer
3. Sequence padding and attention mask creation
4. Model setup and fine-tuning using `BertForSequenceClassification`
5. Evaluation and visualization of results
